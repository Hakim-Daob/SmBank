# System Interfaces 
 
Smooth banking will be interacting with different external system interfaces.  Starting 
with Paypal which is a reliable Web-based application for the secure transfer of money 
between user accounts.  In addition, our system will interact with the bank database 
system, in order to allow its user to read and sometimes update their information. 
The system will also be opened for other third party system interfaces to be added in 
the future with making some changes. 
The system will use some external software interfaces. 
for the database management system, we will be using ODBC API to allow the 
programing language to communicate with Mysql database management 
system. Mysql version that will be used here is 5.6.15. 
for the programing language, java development kit 7 (JDK7) APIs will be used in 
our system.
for web pages developments JavaServer pages api will be used in our system. 
And finally our system will be capable to run on Windows and MAC operating systems, 
as a platform. 

# GUI Interfaces
 
While developing the Graphical user interface(GUI) for Our system, we will take into 
account the quality in use requirements which are defined by ISO-9126 standard like 
Reliability, Efficiency and usability.  On the other hand, we will not be taking 
accessibility requirements into account assuming that the operating system will take 
care of the accessibility aspects during the usage. Our system will provide two main 
user interface: 
 GUI for the users to allow them to interact with our system. 
 GUI for the administration which gives them more authorities to manage the 
 users of the system. 
 
 
# Communications Interfaces 
 
 HTTPS will mainly be used, because this protocol is secured and suitable for an online 
banking system.  Furthermore, the user will be able to access our system through a web 
browser such as Mozilla Firfox.
